# furutaPendulum
This is the code for developing a furuta pendulum. Using a pc as a deep rl learning device, and an arduino as a motor controller.
I was able to get active stabilization around the stabile equilbrium, but obviously unable to get stabilization around the unstable equilibrium.

Below are some pictures and videos of the pendulum
